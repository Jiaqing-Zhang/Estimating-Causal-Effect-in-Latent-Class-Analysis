# Estimating Causal Effects in Latent Class Analysis

## Goal: 
* Estimate average treatment effect when the outcome is latent. 
* Is There a Causal Effect of College Completion on Adult Risk Behavior?

## Data:
* Longitudinal dataset: Add Health, five time points and 31 datasets

## Method:
* Integrate Propensity Score Weighting/Matching and the Latent Class Analysis to Estimate Causal Effect Estimators.
  * Estimate Baseline Covariate Balance Using Standardized Mean Difference and Vairance Ratio.
  * Estimate Propensity Score and Access Overlap.
  * Calculate Weights/Conducted Matching.
  * Access Overlap and Recheck Balance.
  * Determine Classes Number Using Fit Statisitcs 
  * Conduct LCA    

## Results:
* College Completion Leads to Significantly Reduced Odds of Adult Membership in Risk Behavior Class.
